# Goals
*   Simplify bootstrapping by making it more declarative.
*   Reduce resource consumption by ArgoCD during synchronization by decreasing the number of applications it manages.

# Proposed solution
The proposed solution is to use FluxCD to manage infrastructure applications.

# Steps
1.  Bootstrap FluxCD into a cluster using this repository.
2.  Gradually move infrastructure applications from ArgoCD to FluxCD, starting with ArgoCD itself.
