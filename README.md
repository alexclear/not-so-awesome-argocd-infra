# Infrastructure Repository Structure

This repository contains Kubernetes infrastructure configurations managed by ArgoCD. The structure follows GitOps principles where changes to this repository automatically synchronize with the target cluster.

## Core Components

### Main Application
- Defined in [`applicationsets/main-application.yaml`](applicationsets/main-application.yaml)
- Orchestrates all other applications through ApplicationSets

### ApplicationSets
1. **Helm-based Applications**
   - Generated by [`applicationsets/helm-applicationset.yaml`](applicationsets/helm-applicationset.yaml)
   - Processes applications in `applications-helm/` directory
   - Each application is deployed using Helmfile

2. **Raw Manifest Applications**
   - Generated by [`applicationsets/non-helm-applicationset.yaml`](applicationsets/non-helm-applicationset.yaml)
   - Processes applications in `applications-raw/` directory
   - Applications contain direct Kubernetes manifests

## Directory Structure

### applications-helm/
- Each top-level folder represents a Kubernetes namespace
  - Example: `applications-helm/argocd/`
- Each namespace folder contains subfolders representing ArgoCD applications
  - Example: `applications-helm/argocd/argocd/` contains:
    - `helmfile.yaml` - Helmfile configuration
    - `values.yaml` - Helm values

### applications-raw/
- Each top-level folder represents a Kubernetes namespace
  - Example: `applications-raw/argocd/`
- Each namespace folder contains subfolders representing ArgoCD applications
  - Example: `applications-raw/argocd/argocd-secrets/` contains raw Kubernetes manifest YAML files

### Important Note
- **Application Name Uniqueness**: Each ArgoCD application name (the 2nd level subfolders under `applications-helm` and `applications-raw`) must be globally unique across the entire cluster. Duplicate application names will cause conflicts in ArgoCD and prevent proper synchronization.

  **Practical Example**:
  - ❌ Invalid structure (duplicate application names):
    ```
    applications-raw/
    ├── application/
    │   └── network-policies/  # Application name: network-policies
    │       └── policy1.yaml
    └── pg-application/
        └── network-policies/  # Application name: network-policies (DUPLICATE!)
            └── policy2.yaml
    ```
  - ✅ Valid structure (unique application names):
    ```
    applications-raw/
    ├── application/
    │   └── network-policies-application/  # Application name: network-policies-application
    │       └── policy1.yaml
    └── pg-application/
        └── network-policies-pg-application/  # Application name: network-policies-pg-application
            └── policy2.yaml
    ```

## Workflow
1. ArgoCD monitors this repository
2. `main-application.yaml` triggers the two ApplicationSets
3. ApplicationSets scan their respective directories:
   - `applications-helm/` → Helmfile-based apps
   - `applications-raw/` → Raw manifest apps
4. Applications are deployed to their respective namespaces in the target cluster
